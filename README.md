This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application allows a user to recieve some Faucet erc20 Token and to send it to other addresses. The client side is rendered with React. It shows some useful design patterns that you can expand for building your own Dapps.
